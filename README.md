# Network-anamoly-detection
This project focuses on network anomaly detection, specifically the development of a network intrusion detector. The dataset used for this project is the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, which can be found at (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/kdd+cup+1999+data).

In order to build an effective network intrusion detector, I implemented eight different models, each with its own unique approach. These models include:

KNN Model
Linear SVM Model
Quadratic SVM Model
Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier Model
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Classifier
Naive Bayes Model
Decision Tree Classifier Model
Logistic Regression

By utilizing these various models, I aimed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the network intrusion detection system. Each model offers its own strengths and capabilities in identifying and classifying network anomalies. The ultimate goal of this project was to develop a robust and reliable system that can detect and mitigate network intrusions effectively.
