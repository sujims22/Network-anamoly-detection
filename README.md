# Network Anomaly Detection

A machine learning project aimed at developing a network intrusion detection system using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/kdd+cup+1999+data).

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear and Quadratic
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression

Each model contributes to a comprehensive system designed to accurately identify network anomalies.

## Objective
To create a high-accuracy system for detecting and addressing network intrusions.

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the models with the dataset are provided within the repository.
